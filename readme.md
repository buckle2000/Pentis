# Pentis

## What is this

Back in 2015, when I was a junior, I wrote this game nightly just before final exam.

This is a variant of Tetris with 5 squares instead of 4 per unit. That is why I call this game *PentÂ·is*.

It used Windows API, which is relatively easy to use for me.

## How to build

Use [MinGW](https://mingw.org) or [Dev-C++](http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html) to build.

## Drawbacks
- No UTF-8 support. I know no C++ 11 standard at that time.
- Windows only.
